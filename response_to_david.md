Hi David,

Thank you for your willingness to check with the vet team. Based on our current understanding, the approximate breakdown between document formats includes digital PDFs, images, and handwritten documents. Handwritten documents tend to cause the most processing delays due to the complexity of handwriting recognition, which requires significant processing power.

Digital PDFs are generally easier to process, while images require additional image processing steps but are less challenging than handwriting. We appreciate any insights your team can provide on the exact breakdown and any additional challenges you observe.

Looking forward to your update on Monday.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
