# Document Format Assessment Project

## Project Overview
The Document Format Assessment project aims to break down and analyze various document formats like digital PDFs, images, and handwritten documents in the context of processing challenges. Based on team discussions, the project highlights the approximate distribution of these formats and identifies the significant challenges encountered during document processing, particularly with handwritten documents which require advanced recognition technologies.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies for this project, you can use the package manager of your choice. Ensure you have Node.js installed, as this project is built on a JavaScript ecosystem.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-format-assessment.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd document-format-assessment

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage
This project mainly consists of assessments captured in markdown format. The documents provide insights into the processing challenges faced when dealing with different document formats. While no executable code is provided, team members can review the markdown documents for an understanding of the document processing landscape.

### Example:
To view the assessments, you can open the markdown files, such as:

- `document_format_assessment.md`: Contains the comprehensive breakdown and processing challenges.
- `response_to_david.md`: Represents communication regarding the breakdown insights.
