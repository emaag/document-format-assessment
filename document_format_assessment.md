# High-Level Assessment: Document Format Breakdown and Processing Challenges

## Introduction
This document provides a high-level assessment of the approximate breakdown between digital PDFs, images, and handwritten documents in the context of document processing. It also highlights which document formats tend to cause the most processing delays based on a recent conversation among team members.

## Document Format Breakdown (Approximate)
- Digital PDFs: A significant portion of documents are digital PDFs, which are generally easier to process due to their structured format.
- Images: Includes scanned documents and photographs. These require image processing techniques and can vary in quality.
- Handwritten Documents: These are the most challenging due to variability in handwriting styles and require advanced handwriting recognition technologies.

## Processing Challenges by Format
- Digital PDFs: Typically processed efficiently with standard OCR and text extraction tools.
- Images: Processing time can increase due to the need for image enhancement and noise reduction.
- Handwritten Documents: Tend to cause the most processing delays due to the complexity of handwriting recognition and the need for specialized models.

## Observations from the Conversation
- Eric Maag highlighted the need for significant processing power for handwriting recognition.
- David Periscal Garc√≠a mentioned consulting the vet team for more detailed insights, indicating ongoing efforts to quantify the breakdown and challenges.

## Conclusion
Handwritten documents are the primary source of processing delays in document workflows, requiring focused resources and advanced recognition technologies. Digital PDFs and images, while still requiring processing, generally pose fewer challenges.
